# Theory of Evolutionary Integration (TEI) – A Framework Uniting Wisdom and Harmony

**White Paper v1.0.0 – Author: Rogério Figurelli – Date: May 14, 2025**

### Abstract

The **Theory of Evolutionary Integration (TEI)** builds upon the foundation of the **Theory of Primordial Harmony (TPH)** \[3] by incorporating the dimension of **wisdom**. TEI proposes that true systemic evolution occurs when both **wisdom (W)** and **harmony (H)** increase jointly over time. Wisdom is defined as the conscious application of intelligence \[1], and harmony as the resilient coherence among relational components in the presence of entropy \[2]\[4]. The theory introduces a formal expression for **evolution (E)** as the **temporal derivative** of the product between wisdom and harmony, capturing how their interaction generates sustainable systemic development.

This integration reflects a dynamic evolutionary principle inspired by thinkers such as **Darwin** \[7], **Einstein** \[9], **Hawking** \[8], and **Prigogine** \[6]: systems evolve not merely by becoming more connected (harmonious) or more intelligent (wise), but by **deepening their synergy** over time. TEI thus provides a quantitative and conceptual model for evolutionary processes across cognitive, social, ecological, and technological domains.
